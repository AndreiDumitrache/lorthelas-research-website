Our aim is to provide a clear, concise and accurate prediction to a constantly evolving market through the use of fundamental analysis, technical interpretation and an expanding array of financial indicators. We strive to provide accurate market analysis by combining traditional market indicators with novel market predictors.

The cryptocurrency industry is still in its infancy and institutions around the world (both public and private) are yet to observe its capabilities. While we have seen large players like political actors and investment banks make significant moves in this space, there is still a sentiment of fear and detachment among traditional investors. This is the reason why we want to be positioned early, preferably before large private companies and pensions funds invest publicly in risk assets.

This following report aims to provide the basics of what we do and how we think about this industry. Throughout our time in this markets we have gathered significant quantities of information which we believe are of good quality and, most importantly, they are true and tested with our own cash positions.

We hope that subsequent reports, especially during the market cycles, will provide more relevant information.

We understand that this report is not by any means exhaustive and could not cover all the information about this industry, which is why we would also like to mention that we are glad to provide you with any further details you would like to know more about.

We thank you for your trust and attention and hope to have you interested in this industry.
